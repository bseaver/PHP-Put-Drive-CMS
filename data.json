His first taste of what American beer </span><span >could</span><span >&nbsp;be, started a life of inquiry into the many styles and brewing traditions. After beginning home brewing in 1972, and getting to taste New Albion beer in 1977, this interest became a full-blown hobby. Together with two members of his caving team, he established an extensive &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; operation in a separate building at his home. Helping found the &ldquo;San Joaquin WORThogs&rdquo; homebrew club, organizing the first Fresno County Fair beer competition, and participation in numerous other beer competitions, seemed to lead Dan and his buddies to actively consider a brewpub in the late 1980s. This interest resulted in taking an enjoyable &ldquo;beginning a brewery&rdquo; course from Professor Michael Lewis at UC Davis.</span></p><p ><span >After Dan&rsquo;s partners moved on to other interests, he focused on brewing lager beers in the styles of German and Czech brewers. When Dan and his wife moved to Seaside, Oregon, a home brewery was designed into the original build out and Dan continued his active interest in brewing Helles, Pils, Fest, Dunkel and Czech-Style beers. A fortuitous meeting with fellow Buoy founder Luke Colvin in that garage, started the idea to head down the path of a brewery that featured the smooth tastes of properly lagered beers, similar to what Dan had been perfecting for many years.</span></p><p ><span >Dan&rsquo;s interest now is in working with Buoy&rsquo;s production brewers in lager production and recipe formulation (who needs retirement anyway?!), and working hard to find himself back on the golf course as much as possible!</span></p><p ><span ></span></p>",
