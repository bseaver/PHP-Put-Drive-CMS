### This folder (web/cached_images) is used to store image files downloaded from Google User Content
* The .jpegs themselves need not be stored in Git, since they are downloaded to this folder when content is posted to the website.
* Also, files in this folder are automatically erased during processing of posted content, so manually saved files should instead be stored in the web/images folder.
